In our game, 10 is a very strong stat. the max to star with. 1 is the lowest. 
These are the boundaries. 

Mage is high mana, high magic, but low HP/attack character that starts with the fireball spell. 

Shaman is an all-rounder. That starts with a Fire Elemental Pet. weapon. thunderfury.

Warlock is a high HP weak character that will deal most of its damage with summons and starts with an imp pet.

if a character has an activepet, we take the activePets damage as starting value and add it to the characters magic damage
if a character is casting aspell, we take the spells damage and add it to the characters magic damage
if a character has niether an activepet nor a spell we take their weapons damage and add it to the characters attack

## pet logic

a character can have an array of pets but can only summon active pet
